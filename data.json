            "summary": "An oily skin type is exactly what it sounds like – excess oil on the face produces a persistently shiny or greasy appearance. If you don't treat your oily skin, pores can become clogged and enlarged, and dead skin cells may accumulate.",

            "rec1summary": "Hyaluronic Acid is a common ingredient in moisturizers and serums that increases the moisture level in your skin. That might sound counterproductive to your battle against oil, but it’s actually just as important to moisturize oily skin as it is to moisturize dry skin. Often, oily skin is the result of dehydration. Your skin knows when it’s dehydrated and starts producing oil to compensate. Adding Hyaluronic Acid to your routine will ensure that your skin is well hydrated and never looks greasy.",
            "rec2": "Retinol",
            "rec2summary": "Retinol is a superhero skincare ingredient that has a number of benefits like oil regulation, acne relief, wrinkle reduction, and the list goes on. Retinol works by increases the speed of your skin cell turnover process to reveal healthier, brighter skin. The downside of Retinol is that it can be irritating for certain skin types but oily skin is generally the best at receiving this potent, powerhouse ingredient.",

            "rec3summary": "Salicylic Acid is another great ingredient for oily skin, especially if you’re experiencing breakouts as a result of excess oil. Often found in cleansers and toners, Salicylic Acid is an anti-inflammatory ingredient that plows through excess oil, breaks down dead skin cells, and attacks troublesome breakouts the source—deep inside your pores.",

When we said water has to be delivered to the skin properly, this is what we meant.
